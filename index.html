    Airbitz plugins are a way to include additional functionality into the
    Airbitz Bitcoin Wallet. They are currently used to buy and sell bitcoin
    through <a href="https://glidera.io">Glidera</a>, and purchase discounted
    Starbucks and Target cards through <a href="https://foldapp.com">Foldapp</a>.

    These pages serve as an introduction on writing your own plugins.  You only
    need basic web development skills to build your own plugin. If you can
    write HTML, CSS and Javascript, you can easily write a plugin and run it on
    <a href="pages/2-adding-to-native-apps.html#android">Android</a> and 
    <a href="pages/2-adding-to-native-apps.html#ios">iOS</a>.
